# ml-credit-card-fraud
Detect Credit Card Fraud Transactions by using two popular classification models.
These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine.

The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. We will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.

The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Objectives
* Perform basic data preprocessing in Python
* Model a classification task using the Scikit-Learn
* Train Suppport Vector Machine and Decision Tree models using Scikit-Learn
* Run inference and assess the quality of the trained models
